Roles and Permissions
=====================

There are different ways to access and interact with playbooks and this is controlled in the System Console in the form of permissions. Permissions can be granted in a variety of ways, to allow for different combinations of access and visibility, and to different roles.

Permissions in Playbooks are applied to roles and inherited from System Schemes which apply across Mattermost to Members and Playbook Administrators. 

**Member**

In the context of Playbooks, members are users of Mattermost who belong to the team within which the run is active and who may have a vested interest in the run. Depending on the permissions granted, members can have the same privileges as Playbook Admins or restricted privileges.

**Playbook Admin**

In the context of Playbooks, Playbook Admins are also members, but have elevated permissions to change playbook and run visibility and functional settings. The Playbook Admin role is a default role, and members need to be promoted to the role from within Playbooks. The Playbook Admin role then applies across the Playbooks platform. They do not have access to the System Console and their privileges are managed by System and Team Admins.

Manage playbook visibility
--------------------------

The default Playbooks settings are completely open. This means that members can add and remove other members, edit playbooks, convert Public playbooks to Private playbooks and so on. The default settings allow all members to participate in runs, edit playbooks, view runs and playbooks, remove other members from runs, edit actions and make other changes. Permissions provide better control over confidential runs and playbooks, as well as member management.
