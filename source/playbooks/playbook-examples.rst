Choose a Playbook
=================

Playbooks are used to manage workflows - whether those workflows are for a new release, new hire onboarding, or customer training. It can be hard to conceptualize what a playbook is and how it can benefit you without seeing it in action. There are preconfigured templates available in Mattermost Playbooks, and this document outlines the type of events where you'd use them.
